  ## Technologies
    - Node.js

    - MySQL2
    - Sequelize
    - Express-session
    - Dotenv
    - Bcrypt
    - Countapi-js 

  ## Usage:
  XXXXXX   This application utilizes several web and database technologies that allows a user to read technology blogs from other users and comment on blogs or write their own after signing up for access to the website.  A MySQL database is used to store user and blog post data.  The website has a secure authentication process to access the website for both current and new users.  This is an interactive website that allows the users to write new blogs, edit and delete their own blogs, view other userâ€™s blogs, and make comments.  As stated earlier, a MySQL database manages the data, so the user does not have to work about the blog post being erased.  XXXXXXXXX
