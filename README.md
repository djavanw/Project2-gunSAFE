  ## Technologies
    - Node.js
    - Handlebars.js
    - MySQL2
    - Sequelize

  ## Usage:
  This application utilizes several web and database technologies that allows a user to review gun safety articles, broswse guns on an electronic catalog, and store and retrieve a personal gun inventory.  The gun inventory is entered by the user and the application will save the information for later use.  The user gains all of this functionality when he/she is logged into the application.  A MySQL database is used to store user informatio, the users inventory, and the gun catalog.  The website has a secure authentication process to access the website for both current and new users.
